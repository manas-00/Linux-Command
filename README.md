# Linux-Command

The given Bash script defines a custom command-line utility called internsctl. Here's a breakdown of its components without the actual code:

1. **Version Definition:**
A version number (VERSION="v0.1.0") is defined at the beginning of the script.

2. **display_manual Function:**
This function displays the manual page for the internsctl command. It includes information about the command, its options, usage, examples, and version.

**3. display_help Function:**
This function displays help information for the internsctl command. It explains the available options, usage patterns, and specific commands.

**4. File Information Functions:**
Two functions, get_file_info and get_specific_file_info, are defined to retrieve information about a specified file. They include details such as size, permissions, owner, and last modification time.

**5. Main Script Logic:**
The script's main logic is organized using a case statement. It interprets the command-line arguments and executes specific logic based on the provided command. It supports options like --help and --version and includes subcommands for CPU, memory, user, and file operations.

**6. How to Use:**
Users can run the script as a command-line utility by providing appropriate arguments, such as internsctl --help, internsctl --version, or specific commands like internsctl cpu getinfo.

**7. Note:**
The actual logic for CPU, memory, user, and file operations is not fully implemented. Placeholder comments (# Logic for ...) indicate where the specific logic for these operations would be added based on the script's intended functionality.
In summary, the script provides a framework for a customizable command-line utility with features for displaying help and manual pages, retrieving file information, and supporting various subcommands. Users can interact with it by running commands and specifying options based on their needs.
